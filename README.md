# DBProject_6941_9320
A mini database project for managing blood donations for Magen David Adom (MDA).

---

## Project Overview
This project aims to optimize the management of blood donations within MDA, focusing on:
- Tracking donors
- Managing donation stations
- Processing blood bank orders

The system facilitates efficient matching of blood types, donation management, and maintains an up-to-date and reliable database.

We designed the database structure, created ERD and DSD diagrams, and implemented the functionality using **PL/SQL** in an **Oracle** environment.
